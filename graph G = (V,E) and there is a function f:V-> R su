graph G = (V,E) and there is a function f:V-> R such that it is injective we define a function g:E->R as g(u,v) = (f(u) - f(v))^2
And now we keep removing edges one by one on a sorted order and we remove the edge with least weight first until the graph is disconnected. Now suppose A and B are two partitions of it. prove that Max(A) < Min(B) or Max(B) < Min(A).



A i^th gen goblin gives birth to n + 1 - i, (i+1)^th gen goblins and only once.

after kth gen there are n!(H_{k}) goblins where H_{K} = \sum_{i = 1}^k (1\k)
after kth gen there are n(n + 1)(n + 2) ... (n + k -1) goblins 
after kth gen there are n(n + 1)(n + 2) ... (n + k) goblins 
after kth gen there are n!(sum_{i = 1}^k(1/k!) goblins.
